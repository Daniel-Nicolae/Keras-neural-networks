# Keras-neural-networks

This repository contains 3 notebooks, each with a Keras neural network model:

1. An IMDb reviews model, which classifies movie reviews as positive or negative: _binary classification_
2. A Reuters articles model, which classifies news articles into one category out of 46: _multiclass classification_
3. A Boston Housing model, which predicts the price of a house: _regression model_
